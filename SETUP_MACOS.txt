Live Captions - macOS Setup Guide
===================================

Thank you for installing Live Captions!

MICROPHONE MODE
---------------
Microphone mode works immediately - just toggle the microphone button
and start speaking. No additional setup required.


DESKTOP AUDIO MODE (Capturing System Sound)
--------------------------------------------
To capture desktop/system audio (e.g., from video calls, YouTube, etc.),
you need to install BlackHole audio driver:

1. INSTALL BLACKHOLE:
   Open Terminal and run:
   
   brew install blackhole-2ch
   
   Or download from: https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole

2. CREATE MULTI-OUTPUT DEVICE:
   a. Open "Audio MIDI Setup" (in /Applications/Utilities/)
   b. Click the "+" button at bottom left
   c. Select "Create Multi-Output Device"
   d. Check BOTH:
      ☑ Your Headphones/Speakers
      ☑ BlackHole 2ch
   e. Right-click the Multi-Output Device
   f. Select "Use This Device For Sound Output"

3. SET SYSTEM OUTPUT:
   a. Go to System Settings → Sound
   b. Set Output to "Multi-Output Device"

That's it! Now toggle Desktop Audio mode in Live Captions to capture
your system audio.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If Desktop Audio mode doesn't work:
- Make sure BlackHole is installed (check Audio MIDI Setup)
- Verify Multi-Output Device is set as system output
- Restart Live Captions after changing audio settings

If you see no captions:
- Check that your microphone/audio is working
- The app requires a modern CPU for real-time transcription
- Audio is processed locally - nothing is sent to the cloud
